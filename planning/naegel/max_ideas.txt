Game properties:
- regular game of sudoku
- solver feature
- pencil tool
- Leaderboard
- generate new board each time (varying difficulties?)



Classes
Grid itself will be a class
Grid needs class method to generate itself (if too difficult, create a grid that does not vary)
Attributes: row, column, width, height
Perhaps the 9 blocks in the grid can inherit from the grid class (takes row, column, width and height?)
Cells are a class? (probably not - has bool value of whether or not it is filled and what the number it is filled in with)
 
Searching
Searching algorithm for validity of a number (linear search -- is binary search necessary?)
Searching algorithm that zips the solution and the submitted solution to determine if the answer is correct (ONLY WORKS IF THERE IS 1 SOLUTION -- only use if generated sudoku boards are not used)
Pencil tool that adds/removes a ‘penciled’ number depending on whether or not the cell already contains the number
 
Sorting
Leaderboard
 
Recursion
Solver algorithm that recursively calls the next/previous grid depending on the validity of the number in the current cell (base case is if the 81st cell is valid)
