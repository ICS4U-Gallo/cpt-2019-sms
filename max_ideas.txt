Classes
Grid itself will be a class
Grid needs class method to generate itself (if too difficult, create a grid that does not vary)
Attributes: row, column, width, height
Perhaps the 9 blocks in the grid can inherit from the grid class (takes row, column, width and height?)
Perhaps the 81 cells in the grid can inherit from the grid class (probably not)
 
Searching
Searching algorithm for validity of a number (linear search -- does this count??)
Searching algorithm that zips the solution and the submitted solution to determine if the answer is correct (ONLY WORKS IF THERE IS 1 SOLUTION -- only use if generated sudoku boards are not used)
Pencil tool that adds/removes a ‘penciled’ number depending on whether or not the cell already contains the number
 
Sorting
leaderboard???
 
Recursion
Solver algorithm that recursively calls the next/previous grid depending on the validity of the number in the current cell (base case is if the 81st cell is valid)
